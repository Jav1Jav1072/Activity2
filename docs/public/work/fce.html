                    academic and professional points of view. The course gives the students a grasp of the fundamentals on which
                    this engineering is based (mathematics, physics, anthropology and ethics), the future professional careers and the
                    role of a computer engineer in today's society.</p>

                    <p>The course is divided in two parts. the first part addresses the theoretical foundations, while the second helps
                    develop practical skills.</p>

                    <p>The first part covers three fundamental blocks of content.</p>

                    <p>1) Computer Engineering in Society: Background and historical perspective: past, present and future of Computer
                    Engineering. Computer Engineering as an academic discipline or profession. The human factor: anthropological
                    and ethical foundations.</p>
                    <p>2) Information and Data: Information representation. Organization of information.</p>
                    <p>3) Information Processing, Management and Transmission: Fundamentals, current paradigms and trends in
                    computer systems and applications.</p>

                    <p>The second part of the course is devoted to the development of practical skills where an introduction to web
                    development is addressed, through the realization of a project for the creation of a web page on contents related
                    to the course.</p>

                    <p>Besides providing the basics of a computer engineer technical skills, this course contributes to the development
                    basic soft-skills for an engineer, such as teamwork, ethical commitment and communication skills, both oral and
                    written, of technical information, favouring the comprehensive training of the engineer as stated in the educational
                    project of the University.</p>

                    <p>The course "Foundations of Computer Engineering" is meticulously crafted to offer a holistic perspective of
                    Computer Engineering, encompassing its academic and professional dimensions. The main objective of this course
                    is to acquaint students with the fundamental principles that underpin the discipline, including mathematical,
                    physical, anthropological, and ethical foundations. Moreover, it aims to familiarize them with the diverse career
                    opportunities available and the pivotal role assumed by computer engineers in contemporary society.
                    This course is structured into two distinct modules. The initial module delves into theoretical foundations and
                    encompasses three pivotal content blocks:</p>

                    <p>The first block critically examines the intersection of Computer Engineering and Society, exploring its historical
                    antecedents, contextualizing its present state, and contemplating its future trajectory. Moreover, it elucidates
                    Computer Engineering as an academic discipline and profession, and delves into the profound human aspects
                    such as anthropological and ethical foundations.</p>
                    

                    <p>The second block focuses on the fundamental principles of Computer Engineering, aiming to comprehend the
                    inner workings of computers and identify their key components.</p>
                    

                    <p>Finally, the last block revolves around Data management, processing, and communication. It not only
                    elucidates the fundamental concepts but also explores current paradigms and emerging trends in systems and
                    applications.</p>
                    

                    <p>The second module of the course is dedicated to fostering practical skills. Herein, workshops play a pivotal role,
                    fostering teamwork, the production of well-crafted printed documentation, and the delivery of impactful oral
                    presentations to diverse audiences. Significantly, the laboratories provide an invaluable opportunity for students to
                    gain hands-on experience in web development by embarking on a project centered around the creation of a web
                    page exploring topics relevant to the subject.</p>
                    <p>
                    In addition to the cultivation of technical competencies, this course espouses the development of essential skills
                    requisite for future engineers. It emphasizes the significance of teamwork, ethical commitment, and effective
                    communication skills, both oral and written, particularly in the technical domain. By embracing these overarching
                    goals, this course aims to nurture well-rounded engineers who embody the comprehensive educational vision
                    outlined in the university's educational project.</p></div>
